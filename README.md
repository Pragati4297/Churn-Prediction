# Churn-Prediction
Customer churn has become a big issue in many banks because it costs a lot more to acquire a new customer than retaining existing ones. With the use of a customer churn prediction model possible churners in a bank can be identified, and as a result the bank can take some action to prevent them from leaving. In order to set up such a model in a bank in Iceland few things have to be considered. How a churner in a bank is defined, and which variables and methods to use.  Behavioral and demographic variables should be used as an input for the model, and either decision tree or logistic regression used as a technique.
